# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository documents and demonstrates key aspects of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It serves as:
- A reference for best practices in gathering and analyzing software requirements
- A collection of templates for requirement documentation (SRS, use cases, etc.)
- A workspace for analyzing real-world requirement scenarios

## Key Topics Covered
1. Requirement gathering techniques (interviews, surveys, workshops)
2. Functional vs non-functional requirements
3. Use case modeling and user stories
4. Requirement validation and prioritization
5. Tools for requirement management (JIRA, Confluence, etc.)

## Repository Structure

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the critical first phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs are systematically gathered, documented, analyzed, and validated before any development begins. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent development activities.

### Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis:
1. **Elicitation**  
   - Gathering requirements through techniques like:  
     • Stakeholder interviews  
     • User surveys  
     • Workshops  
     • Market research  

2. **Specification**  
   - Documenting requirements in clear, measurable terms using:  
     • Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)  
     • User stories  
     • Use case diagrams  

3. **Validation**  
   - Ensuring requirements are:  
     • Complete (cover all needed functionality)  
     • Consistent (no contradictions)  
     • Feasible (technically/budgetarily achievable)  

4. **Prioritization**  
   - Ranking requirements by:  
     • Business value  
     • Implementation complexity  
     • Regulatory needs  

### Importance in SDLC:
- **Reduces rework** by catching ambiguities early (fixing a requirement error in analysis phase costs 100x less than in production)
- **Aligns stakeholders** through clear documentation that serves as a single source of truth
- **Guides architecture** by defining system constraints and capabilities upfront
- **Prevents scope creep** through controlled requirement change processes
- **Enables accurate estimation** of timelines and resources
